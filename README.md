# BLB People

People (HR) domain for the [Belimbing (BLB)](https://github.com/BelimbingApp/belimbing) framework: Attendance, Leave, Claim, Payroll, Benefits, Performance, Recruitment, Training, the Employees workbench, and People Settings.

This repository is a **nested-git domain repo**. It mounts at `app/Domains/People/` inside a Belimbing checkout; the framework discovers its providers, migrations, menus, routes, settings, and tests by path convention — no registration step. See `docs/architecture/module-system.md` in the main repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BelimbingApp/belimbing
git clone https://github.com/BelimbingApp/blb-people belimbing/app/Domains/People
```

Licensed under MIT, same as the framework.
