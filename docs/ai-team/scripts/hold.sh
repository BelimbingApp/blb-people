# Set or clear a *named* review hold — one label per holding reviewer, so two
# reviewers with independent open findings on the same PR never collapse into
# one anonymous `hold:review` boolean that either can remove (#385).
#
#   CLAIM_AGENT=<stable-agent-id> docs/ai-team/scripts/hold.sh review add <pr-number>
#   CLAIM_AGENT=<stable-agent-id> docs/ai-team/scripts/hold.sh review clear <pr-number>
#
# `add` creates the PR-scoped label `hold:review:<agent>` (creating the label
# itself on first use, the same lazy pattern claim.sh uses for `agent:<id>`)
# and applies it. Plain `clear` (no --steward) removes only CLAIM_AGENT's own
# label — never another holder's.
#
# Steward transfer of an unresponsive holder's hold — the one case where a
# third party may clear a hold that isn't theirs — requires the target agent,
# an explicit verifiable-finding classification, and a recorded reason, all
# mandatory together, never inferred:
#
#   CLAIM_AGENT=<steward-id> docs/ai-team/scripts/hold.sh review clear <pr-number> \
#     --steward <holder-agent> --discharge verifiable \
#     --reason "<what was discharged, and how you know>"
#
# `--discharge judgment` is deliberately refused: a steward can verify an
# observable fact on behalf of an unresponsive holder, but cannot silently
# substitute their own judgment for the reviewer's. The named hold stays set
# until its holder accepts the trade or otherwise records a superseding verdict.
#
# This clears exactly hold:review:<holder-agent> — no other holder's label is
# touched — and posts the reason as a headered PR comment, so "I named the
# absent holder in a comment" (once unread prose) becomes durable, attributed
# evidence the gate's history and any later reader can see. Skipping this path
# for a bare `gh pr edit --remove-label` is exactly the failure this script
# exists to prevent: the tool becomes the thing you route around at the one
# moment attribution matters most.
#
# `--steward` names who is acting and checks no role of its own — any agent can
# pass it. `--discharge verifiable` and the recorded --reason make the claim
# auditable: the script cannot prove the classification, but it can prevent the
# ambiguity from disappearing into an untyped status comment. Do not mistake
# the flag for a permission check.
#
# A pre-#385 unattributed bare `hold:review` label has no owner to name, so
# it clears through a separate, explicit path rather than by accident:
#
#   CLAIM_AGENT=<agent-id> docs/ai-team/scripts/hold.sh review clear <pr-number> \
#     --legacy --reason "<what was discharged, and how you know>"
#
# hold:author is unaffected — it names the PR's one author lane already, so it
# has no multi-holder ambiguity to fix.
