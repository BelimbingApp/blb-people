# replaces: keep repository-specific facts — source pins, assembly checks,
# project commands — here, so the guide and the generic mechanisms beside it
# stay portable.
#
# This copy is the home repository's own, where the project *is* the package.

# orient.sh exports AI_TEAM_DEFAULT_BRANCH before invoking this hook — copied
# out to .ai-team/ at the repository root (#8), this file has no relative path
# back to package/scripts/_default_branch.sh, so it cannot resolve the branch itself.
# The fallback covers a direct run of this hook outside orient.sh.

== ai-team project: commands worth knowing ==
  python3 -m unittest discover -s package/scripts -p 'test_*.py'   run the mechanism suite
  package/scripts/orient.sh                                        read the board

Every change here lands in the repositories that mount this package at
docs/ai-team/, so a mechanism change is a change to how other teams work.
Prove it with a test in the same PR.
